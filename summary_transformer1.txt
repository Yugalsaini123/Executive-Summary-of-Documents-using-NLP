The Well has a well type of "B" Tripura Forward Base, AAFB, Agartala, India. Tripura Mega Merge vol. 66 (ADAV) Report of AD#66: Tripura Well Completion Report. Well spudded-in on 08.05.2023 at 12:30 hrs. Drilling completed on 16.06.20 23 at 17:45 hrs. Rig released on 26.06, 2023 at 06:00 hrs. No conventional core was cut in this well. No production testing was carried out in Agartala Dome structure is the most prolific hydrocarbon accumulation in Tripura. With around 25 BCM in-place gas reserves, it is the single largest field in the state. A total of 64 wells have been drilled in this structure. The Assam and Assam Arakan Basin evolved as a result of rifting and drifting of the Indian Plate towards north and then north east after the break up from Gondwanaland. Drifting of Indian subcontinent during Cretaceous time led to subduction of Indian plate margin below Burmese plate. Arakan ophiolite belt marks the obducted oceanic crust during collision and marks the boundary between Indian and Burmese plates. The entire Indo–Burmese orogenic belt represents an accretionary prism complex moving westward due to continuous eastward subduction of the Indian plate. Tripura-Cachar Fold Belt comprises a series of sub-parallel elongated anticlines trending NNW-SSE. In Tripura, through remote sensing studies and systematic geological mapping, 24 major structures have been identified. Proven gas producing reservoirs are established mainly within the arenace. The most important structural element within the study area is the East Baramura Thrust. Potential of Lower Bhuban, Renji & Barail sediments are yet to be proved. The Barjala-Sundulbari structural high trend has its origin in the development of a west verging fault, which is antithetic to the East Baramura Thrust. This fault does not emerge onto the surface and is therefore a blind fault. Splaying out from the East Baramura Thrust, the West Barjala Fault has developed a The oldest exposed stratigraphic unit in Tripura-Cachar region is Barail Group of Oligocene age, unconformably overlain by the lithostratigraphic units. The Surma Group of sediments is further subdivided into Bhubans and Bokabil. During the Middle Eocene to Early Miocene the collision of Indian plate with Burmese plate and Tibetan plate, results in a major switch in sedimentation pattern over the then Bengal Basin. The Tripura Fold Belt has undergone several stages of sedimentation. Most of the sand facies in Tripura are heterogeneous and lenticular in nature. The Tripura fold belt has undergone four stages of basin development. The sediments deposited during the rifting of India from Gondwana. Brahmaputra was depositing its sediment into the Cachar-Tripura area from the north-east. Sediments deposited at this time in the eastern fold belt                 and Surma range in thickness from 10-15 km and were deposited in deltaic regime. Upper Bhuban sediments in the area are believed to be deposited in the mouth bar to distal                 bar to pro-delta regime (Dutta et.al.1993). The Bokabil sediments are deposited in delta                 front environment. Cores from few wells of Agartala Dome shows, dominance of shale facies. Moderate to high energy condition of deposition is inferred. Biostratigraphic and paleontological studies indicate that the sediments are of Middle Miocene age. Tipam Formation consists of thick bedded, massive coarse grained sandstone with minor clay and shale interbeds. It is well exposed on the crest and limbs of some of the anticlines in Cachar and Tripura. The Sandstone is characterized by                 lithic wacke with minor association of calcareous quartz. ereas in majority of                 the structures in Cachar, Tipams are totally eroded. The majority of the fold-belt area has an N-S or The location ADAV was spudded as AD#66 on 08.05.2023 at 12:30hrs. The hole was thoroughly conditioned and total 21 joints of 20” casing were lowered and the casing was cemented keeping casing shoe at  grotesque261m. After WOC, well-head and BOP stack were installed. Drilling Phase: 262-1853m (Plan Days: 15/ Actual Days: 16.65) TCR (RR) bit was lowered and cement top was tagged at 249m. Cement and casing shoe were drilled up to 261.5m and SIT was carried with 120 psi surface pressure using 1.07 SG. Cement was cemented with 1.95SG lead cement slurry with planned cement rise of 400m from casing shoe. Well head was installed and successfully tested at 300/2000psi. Ram BOPs were tested at300/3000psi and annular BOP was tested at 3/4”. Fresh formation was drilled up to 1860m and PIT was carried out by applying surface pressure 835 psi, obtained MWE: 1.50 SG. The 12 ¼” hole was further drilled down to 1867m and changed over                 mud system to KCl-PHPA-Polyol-Polyamine system. Further 12 ¾’ hole was drilled 8 ½” TCR (RR) bit with slick BHA was run in and tagged float collar at 2475m. CIT was carried out at 2400psi with 1.2 SG mud and found holding at 2499.5m. The hole was further drilled down to 2505m and PIT was carried out by applying surface pressure up No interesting zone was identified from Hydrocarbon point of view. Therefore, the well was abandoned permanently without lowering 5 ½” casing as per SOP. Abandoned without 5.5" casing. To explore hydrocarbon prospects in Upper Bhuban sands (AP-36).

Driller’s depth: 3011m, loggers’ depth:  3016m. No Formation Pressure Tests & Samples (MDT/RCI):  No MDT/ Pre-drill pore pressure analysis for the well AD#66(ADAV) was carried out. The analysis inferred a near hydrostatic regime up to a depth of 3011m (TD) The maximum formation pressure predicted at TD is 1.10 SG. Shale factor is a measure of clay cation exchange capacity (CEC) represented as                 milliequivalents (of a suitable ion) per hundred grams (of the compound) Various clay types have different CEC’s and CEC in general decrease as clays convert from montmorillonite-rich to illite- rich with temperature. Shale density and shale factor studies were carried out at 10m intervals from 820m to 3011m. Shale factor plot shows a gradual decreasing trend with depth. The overall trend indicates transformation of montmorillonite to illite with increasing depth. D-exponent and sigma values were plotted against drilled depth from 262m to 3011m. Compaction and differential pressure is dependent on mud density, as well as formation pore pressure. No well activity was encountered during drilling. Pore pressure analysis for the well AD#66 (ADAV) was carried out based on nearby well data. The analysis inferred a hydrostatic regime upto a depth of 2670m. Pore pressure upto 3011m  was observed to be in the hydrostatic to near hydrostatic with 1.10 SG at TD. PIT in 17 ½” hole (at 261m MD/ 261m TVD) at 261mMD/ 261MTVD. Graph of PIT in 17 1/2’ hole. Well Completion Report of AD#66. Well Completion Report of AD#66 (ADAV) is published by Tripura Forward Base, AAFB, Agartala, India. The well was drilled at 1853m MD/ 1732m TVD. The temperature of mud at flow line (FLT) was recorded from 600m till 3564m. FLT increased gradually from 43°C at 260m to 73°C  at 3011m (TD) No abrupt  change in flow line temperature was observed except during tripping. Horner temperature was deduced based on BHT recorded in different log runs and time elapsed since last circulation. In 17 ½” and 12 ¼” open hole, only one BHT data from logging is available for each                 phase. Three successive runs run#1:   grotesqueRTEX-MLL-DSL-SP-ORIT, run#2 No reservoir studies were carried out in this well. Maximum recorded log head temperatures wherever logs were recorded was used for a temperature gradient plot. The overall temperature gradient gives a value of 2.34°C/100m.
