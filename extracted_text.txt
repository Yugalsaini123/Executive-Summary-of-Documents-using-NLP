CHAPTER 1:  
INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Exploration History in Brief 
Agartala Dome structure is the most prolific hydrocarbon accumulation in Tripura. It is a 
very subtle dome-like feature lying between highly deformed Baramura structure and 
Rokhia structure. With around 25 BCM in-place gas reserves, it is the single largest 
field in Tripura. A total of 64 wells have been drilled in this structure. 8 pay sands have 
been established in this field. AP-10B of Upper Bhuban is the most successful pay sand 
established in the Agartala Dome field. It is a relict-feature which is formed by the action 
of canyons eroding through the earlier deposited beds. The cuts thus formed were filled 
up by transgressing shale, thus providing the lateral and top sealing to these relicts. 
Hence, relict features are an excellent exploration target. 
1.1.1 Geological Set-up (Tectonics & Structure, Brief of Stratigraphy) 
Tectonic Setting of the Basin 
The Assam and Assam Arakan Basin evolved as a result of rifting and drifting of the 
Indian Plate towards north and then north east after the break up from Gondwanaland. 
Drifting of the Indian subcontinent during Cretaceous time led to subduction of Indian 
plate margin below the Burmese plate. Oblique subduction of the Indian plate initiated 
closing of the Neo-Tethys Ocean at northeast and then gradually progressed 
southward. Intervening ocean became progressively narrower towards south. 
Subsequent to the closure of the Neo-Tethys Ocean along Arakan Yoma Suture, 
collision of the continent plates resulted in the development of the Arakan-Burmese 
Mountain Range. Further compression initiated thrusting and stack of thrust sheets 
(Schuppen Belt) at north eastern part. At about 10 Ma, all the oceanic crust in the 
Assam region at the margin of the Indian continent had subducted under the West 
Burma Plate and initiated extremely oblique collision of the Indian and West Burma 
Plates. The Assam-Arakan ophiolite belt marks the obducted oceanic crust during 
collision and marks the boundary between Indian and Burmese plates.  
The entire Indo–Burmese orogenic belt represents an accretionary prism complex 
migrating westward due to continuous eastward subduction of the Indian plate from 
Late Cretaceous to end of Oligocene. The prism complex as a whole becomes younger

   Tripura Forward Base, AAFB, Agartala                                                                                 Page 2 
in the westward direction (Hutchinson, 1989; Varga, 1997). The westward migration of 
the prism complex is believed to have continued through the Tripura-Cachar Fold Belt 
as the „Neogene Accretionary Prism‟ (Dasgupta and Nandy, 1995), which developed 
above the obliquely subducting Indian lithosphere. Tripura-Cachar Fold Belt had 
undergone severe folding, faulting and thrusting during different phases of post collision 
orogeny, the intensity of which increases eastward. Initiation of structuration is 
considered to have occurred during Mio-Pliocene probably after the deposition of 
Tipam.  
Tectonically, the Tripura-Cachar Fold Belt comprises a series of sub-parallel elongated 
en-echelon anticlines trending NNW-SSE with slight convexity towards west. The 
anticlines are bounded by longitudinal reverse faults on one or both limbs (Kunte, 
1989).  
In Tripura, through remote sensing studies and systematic geological mapping, 24 
major structures (18 exposed and 6 concealed) have been identified. So far 18 
structures have been probed. In total 11 structures (07 fields are put on production & 04 
fields yet to be put on production) have established gas reserves in Bokabil, Upper 
Bhuban, Middle Bhuban and Lower Bhuban reservoirs.  
In general the stratigraphy of the area is represented by thick clastic sequence of 
Tertiary rocks. Mio-Pliocene and younger sediments are exposed on the surface. 
Proven gas producing reservoirs are established mainly within the arenaceous facies of 
Bhuban formations. However, potential of Lower Bhuban, Renji & Barail sediments are 
yet to be proved. 
Structural Analysis  
Structural analysis of the Western Tripura sector was taken up through integration of 
surface geological dataset with the subsurface dataset including seismic profiles and 
drilled well data. The integrated G & G analysis reveals that the most important 
structural element within the study area is the East Baramura Thrust, which has 
vergence towards the east, and is thus a major back thrust (Fig. No. III.1). The 
spectacularly long N-S trending Baramura structure has developed on the hanging wall 
of this major back thrust. In the vicinity of the western limit of the study area, near the 
international boundary with Bangladesh, the Rokhia structure is observed in seismic 
sections to be developed on the East Rokhia Thrust, which also is a back thrust. In 
 
 
Well Completion Report of AD#66 (ADAV) 
   Tripura Forward Base, AAFB, Agartala                                                                                 Page 3 
analogy to other similar fold thrust belts across the world, and in conformity with the 
recent structural understanding in adjacent Cachar sector, the Rokhia and the 
Baramura structures, in all probability, are genetically related and are envisaged to 
have emerged as east verging splays from a deep seated regional decollement which is 
present below the western Tripura sector and is progressively advancing into the 
undisturbed Bangladesh foreland.  
The analysis of available data indicates that the Barjala-Sundulbari structural high trend 
owes its origin to the development of a west verging fault (referred here as the West 
Barjala Fault), which is antithetic to the East Baramura Thrust. This fault does not 
emerge onto the surface and is therefore a blind fault. Splaying out from the East 
Baramura Thrust, the West Barjala Fault has developed a blind antithetic fault of its own 
- the East Baramura Bulge Fault – on which the Baramura Bulge structure has 
developed. 
Generalized Stratigraphy 
The oldest exposed stratigraphic unit in Tripura-Cachar region is Barail Group of 
sediments of Oligocene age, unconformably overlain by the lithostratigraphic units 
broadly subdivided into Miocene Surma Group, Pliocene Tipam Group and Pleistocene 
Dupitila Group (Nandy et al. 1983). The lithology, mineralogy and sedimentary features 
indicate that the Neogene sediments of Surma Group are argillaceous as well as 
arenaceous sequences.  
The Surma Group of sediments is further subdivided into Bhubans and Bokabil. The 
Bhuban is further subdivided into three litho-units viz. Lower, Middle and Upper Bhuban 
depending upon the relative abundance of coarser and finer clastics (Evans 1930). 
Bokabil Formation of Late Miocene to Early Pliocene age overlies the Bhuban 
formations. Lower and Upper Bhuban formations are more arenaceous in composition. 
The Middle Bhuban unit is dominantly argillaceous and composed mainly of mudstone, 
shale, 
shale-siltstone 
alternation, 
shale-sandstone 
alternation. 
Surma 
Group 
succession is devoid of age-diagnostic fauna and marker horizons hence 
biostratigraphy control is constrained. Surma Group is overlain by the dominantly 
arenaceous Tipam Formation deposited in fluvial environment. Tipams are overlain by 
the Dupitila and the Alluvium ranging from Pleistocene to Recent age. These are 
exposed in the synclinal areas of Tripura.

Depositional Regime  
During the Middle Eocene to Early Miocene the collision of Indian plate with Burmese 
plate and Tibetan plate, results in a major switch in sedimentation pattern over the then 
Bengal Basin. The Tripura Fold Belt has undergone several stages of sedimentation. 
Surma Group (Bokabil and Bhuban formations) sediments are supposed to be 
deposited in a deltaic setting (Holtrop and Keizer, 1970; Johnson and Alam, 1991) with 
occasional marine transgressions (Seshavataram et.al, 1973 and 1975). Most of the 
sand facies in Tripura are heterogeneous and lenticular in nature. The Tripura fold belt 
has undergone four stages of basin development i) The sediments deposited during the 
rifting of India from Gondwana. The synrift history is known only from the western 
margin and northern margin (Dauki Fault area). These sediments rest unconformably 
over the basement. The unconformity separating the breakup sediments from the post 
breakup sedimentation is represented by Lower Cretaceous Rajmahal trap (Curiale et 
al., 2002). ii). The sediments deposited during drifting consist of Cretaceous to Eocene 
deposits overlying Upper Paleozoic and Mesozoic Gondwana graben deposits of 
largely 
continental 
origin 
(Alam, 
1989). 
iii). 
Early 
collision 
sedimentation 
contemporaneous with continental collision (Oligocene-late Miocene), when initial uplift 
of the Himalayan and Indo-Burmese ranges occurred. At this time, the proto-

   Tripura Forward Base, AAFB, Agartala                                                                                 Page 5 
Brahmaputra was depositing its sediment into the Cachar-Tripura area from the north-
east. The north-westerly movement of India and the northerly movement of the West 
Burma Plate caused the frontal fold belt of the Burmese accretionary prism to move 
westwards (Robertson, 1999). Sediments deposited at this time in the eastern fold belt 
and Surma range in thickness from 10-15 km and were deposited in deltaic regime with 
marine incursions mainly in the Oligocene–Late Miocene (Curiale et al., 2002). iv). The 
Late collision sediments include the Upper Bhuban and Bokabil units overlain by Tipam 
and Dupitila units. The sedimentological studies indicate that the Middle Bhuban 
sediments were deposited in pro-delta to delta front environment, whereas the Upper 
Bhuban sediments in the area are believed to be deposited in the mouth bar to distal 
bar to pro-delta regime (Dutta et.al.1993). The Bokabil sediments are deposited in delta 
front environment. Gradually the depositional environment changed to fluvial conditions 
during deposition of Tipam Formation. Uplift of the Shillong Plateau along the Dauki 
Fault closed the direct path of Brahmaputra, forcing it northwards around the Shillong 
Plateau to its present position at the end of the Miocene to Early Pliocene (Roy 
Choudhury, 2010).  
Upper Bhuban  
Many wells have penetrated upper Bhuban and it is also well exposed on the crest and 
limbs of some of the anticlines in Cachar and Eastern Tripura. Sedimentological studies 
indicate that, in general, the rock is composed of medium grained quartz wacke and 
calcareous quartz wacke with thin beds of silty shale.  
Cores from Upper Bhuban from various wells of Tripura and Cachar show presence 
channel sands with small bottom scours, cross laminations, rippled shale, current 
ripples, parallel lamination. Moderate to high energy condition of deposition is inferred 
from core studies of wells of Rokhia, Tichna, Agartala Dome in a delta slope 
environment. Cores from few wells of Agartala Dome shows, dominance of shale facies 
indicating low energy condition of deposition possibly in prodelta regime which is also 
corroborated by presence of glauconite.  
Biostratigraphic and paleontological studies indicate that the sediments of Upper 
Bhuban are of Middle Miocene age. The sedimentological and paleontological data, 
sand percentage maps and lithofacies from logs indicated deltaic depositional 
environment with tidal effect.

   Tripura Forward Base, AAFB, Agartala                                                                                 Page 6 
Bokabil Formation  
This is mainly an argillaceous sequence consisting of claystone and silty shale with thin 
beds of medium grained sandstone and is well exposed on the crest and limbs of some 
of the anticlines in Cachar and Tripura.  
Sedimentological studies of cores indicate that the sands are massive, laminated at 
places with occasional streaks and stringers of shale pebbles and infrequent cross 
bedding and possibly deposited as distributary mouth bar in deltaic environment. 
Biostratigraphic and paleontological studies indicate that the sediments of Bokabil 
Formation are of Late Miocene age based on LAD of Apteodinium australiense. 
Considering these sedimentological and paleontological data, sand percentage maps 
and lithology from log, the facies cum depositional model of Bokabil was prepared 
showing deltaic environment with tidal effect.  
Tipam Formation  
Tipam Formation consists of thick bedded, massive coarse grained sandstone with 
minor clay and shale interbeds. In Tripura, in the core of the exposed anticlines, Tipam 
is eroded and is preserved only in the flanks and synclinal areas. Whereas in majority of 
the structures in Cachar, Tipams are totally eroded. The Sandstone is characterized by 
lithic wacke with minor association of calcareous quartz wacke.  
Integrating sedimentological, paleontological data and various sand maps facies cum 
depositional model of Tipam has been prepared with depositional environment inferred 
as fluvial braided system. The majority of the fold-belt area has an N-S or NE-SW 
trending arenaceous facies.

CHAPTER 4: 
PORE PRESSURE ANALYSIS/ SPECIAL STUDIES 
4.1 Pre-Drill Pressure Prediction 
Pre-drill pore pressure analysis for the well AD#66(ADAV) was carried out based on the 
nearby well data. The analysis inferred a near hydrostatic regime up to a depth of 
3011m (TD). The maximum formation pressure predicted at TD is 1.10 SG.

4.2.2 Shale Density and Shale factor 
Shale density, under normal compaction scenario, increases with depth. Any deviation 
from this consistent trend may indicate existence of geopressure. The magnitude of the 
bulk density change varies with the type and magnitude of the geopressure. Often, the 
bulk density will decrease, but in some cases it may remain constant or continue to 
increase but at a lower rate than the previous established trend.  
Shale factor is a measure of clay cation exchange capacity (CEC) represented as 
milliequivalents (of a suitable ion) per hundred grams (of the compound). Various clay 
types have different CEC‟s and CEC in general decrease as clays convert from 
montmorillonite-rich to illite-rich with temperature (and thus with depth). Pure 
montmorillonite clays have a CEC of approximately 100 meq/100g. Pure illites show no 
swelling characteristics, but their CEC is generally between 10 and 40 meq/100g.  
In a geopressured zone, caused due to compaction disequilibrium, shale factor will 
increase within the pressured zone as a result of restriction of dewatering of 
montmorillonite/ smectite clay minerals. However, with depth if clays diagenesis occurs 
from montmorillonite to illite, then shale factor will decrease within the pressure zone.  
Shale representative samples were selected so as to obtain the true shale density and 
shale factor with minimum contaminations. Shale density and shale factor studies were 
carried out at 10m intervals from 820m to 3011m.  
The shale density shows gradual increasing trend with depth and the values range from 
2.0 to 2.61 gm/cc showing normal compaction trend.  
Shale factor plot shows a gradual decreasing trend with depth and the values range 
from 7.0 to 4.6 meq/100cc. The overall trend indicates transformation of montmorillonite 
to illite with increasing depth.

Figure-4.3: Shale Density & Shale Factor Plot 
4.2.3 D-exponent and Sigma Plot 
For similar lithology, D-exponent increases with depth, compaction, and differential 
pressure at bottom. In a geo-pressured zone, compaction and differential pressure 
decreases and is reflected by a decrease in d-exponent. Differential pressure is 
dependent on mud density, as well as formation pore pressure. Therefore, any change 
in the mud density used promotes an unwanted change in d-exponent.

D-exponent and sigma values were plotted against drilled depth from 262m to 3011m 
(DD). The plots show a normal compaction trend from 262m to 3011m.

Pre-drill vs Post-drill Pore Pressure Analysis 
Pre-drill pore pressure analysis for the well AD#66 (ADAV) was carried out based on 
the nearby well data. The analysis inferred a hydrostatic regime upto a depth of 2670m. 
Thereafter the pore pressure gradient increases marginally attaining pressures 
equivalent to 1.16SG at target depth i.e 3011m (MDKB) 
Post drill Pore pressure plot has been generated for the well AD#66 (ADAV) using 
available drilling, geological, mud logging and wireline data. Pore pressure upto 3011m 
was observed to be in the hydrostatic to near hydrostatic with 1.10 SG at TD.

Horner Plot 
Maximum recorded temperatures of different wireline log suites were plotted against the 
log (T/(t+T)). Where „T‟ is the time since circulation of drilling fluid stopped, and „t‟ is the 
total circulation time before wireline tool lowering. Horner temperature was deduced 
based on BHT recorded in different log runs and time elapsed since last circulation. 
In 17 ½” and 12 ¼” open hole, only one BHT data from logging is available for each 
phase. Thus Horner‟s BHT extrapolation could not be generated. 
In 8 ½” phase, open hole logs were used to derive BHT. Three successive runs run#1:  
RTEX-MLL-DSL-SP-ORIT, run#2: CN-ZDL-GR and run#3: XMAC-GR were recorded up to 
2762m TVDKB after 11 hrs, 15.5 hrs and 19.5 hrs since circulation stopped respectively 
with the log head BHT recorded being 195.88oF, 194.52oF and 196.96oF. Horner‟s BHT 
extrapolated generated a value of 202.28 oF at 2762mTVDKB (Average depth).

5.3 Bottom Hole Temperature (Reservoir Studies) 
No reservoir studies were carried out in this well. 
5.4 Geothermal Analysis 
Maximum recorded log head temperatures wherever logs were recorded was used for 
temperature gradient plot. The surface temperature was assumed to be 30°C.The BHT 
value was 94.60°C at 2762m TVDKB during recording of 8 ½‟‟ open hole log. There was 
only a single recorded temperature data each during recording of 17 ½” and 12 ¼” open 
hole logs due to which Horner‟s corrected temperature could not be calculated. The 
following temperature gradients were deduced from temperature data. The overall 
temperature gradient gives a value of 2.34°C/100m.

WELL ABANDONMENT 
 
10. WELL ABANDONMENT: 
In view of no interesting zone, it was decided to permanently abandon the well. 
10.1 Abandonment Plug Details 
10.1.1 Bottom abandonment plug 
After a round trip 5” Open-ended drill pipe was run in hole to 2800m. A weighted hi-viscous 
pill (1.5 SG & visc -150) was placed covering the interval 2500-2800m. Thereafter OEDP was 
pulled out to 2532m and bottom abandonment cement plug job was carried out with 10.8m3 of 
1.92 SG cement slurry covering the interval 2302m-2532m. After WOC for 24 hours, cement 
top was tagged at 2334m and successfully tested at 1000psi.
